<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><p>README.md</p><h1>Signal and Systems</h1><p>This repository contains code examples and projects from the Signal and Systems course. The course provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts and principles of signal processing, systems theory, and their applications in various fields.</p><h2>Contents</h2><p>The repository is organized into the following directories:</p><ul><li><code>Matlab_intro</code>: Contains introductory MATLAB examples and exercises to get familiarized with the MATLAB programming language.</li><li><code>Signal_processing</code>: Contains examples of signal processing techniques such as filtering, Fourier transforms, and wavelet transforms.</li><li><code>Systems_theory</code>: Contains examples of system properties such as stability, causality, linearity, and time invariance.</li></ul><h2>Getting Started</h2><p>To run the code examples in this repository, you will need to have MATLAB installed on your computer. You can download a free trial version of MATLAB from the MathWorks website.</p><h2>Contributing</h2><p>Contributions to this repository are welcome. If you find a bug, have a suggestion for an improvement, or would like to add an example or project, please submit an issue or pull request.</p><h2>
